    "# **Robots That Ask For Help: Uncertainty Alignment for Large Language Model Planners** Tabletop Rearrangement\n",
    "\n",
    "[KnowNo](https://robot-help.github.io) is a framework for measuring and aligning the uncertainty of LLM-based planners, such that they know when they don't know, and ask for help when needed. KnowNo builds on the theory of conformal prediction to provide statistical guarantees on task completion while minimizing human help.\n",
    "\n",
    "This colab runs an example of KnowNo for tabletop rearrangement in simulation (first experiment setting in the paper):\n",

    "<img src=\"https://robot-help.github.io/img/robot-help-teaser.png\" height=\"280px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "* We use [GPT-3.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) (text-davinci-003) as the language model here.\n",
    "* For convenience, we will assume known locations of the objects on the table. Alternatively, one can use open-vocab object detectors such as [Owl-ViT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06230) for perception as done in the paper.\n",
    "* The calibration invoves running LLM inference for calibration data. We recommend 200 data for good calibration results. You can also skip the calibration and directly test in new scenarios at the last block based on provided calibration result, or check out this colab.\n",
